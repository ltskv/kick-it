\chapter{Implementation details}

\section{Code organization}

Our code is organized as a standard Python package. The following command can
be used to make the robot run the whole goal scoring sequence:

\begin{verbatim}
  python -m pykick
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, individual modules can be run with the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
  python -m pykick.[filename_without_.py]
\end{verbatim}

The main logic of our implementation can be found in the following files:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \verb|__main__.py| contains the state machine described in the section
    \ref{p sec overview}.

  \item \verb|striker.py| contains implementation of higher level behaviors,
    such as aligning the ball and the goal, or turning to ball.

  \item \verb|finders.py| contains implementations of our detection algorithms.

  \item \verb|imagereaders.py| contains some convenience classes for capturing
    video output from various video sources, such as Nao cameras, web-cameras
    or video files.

  \item \verb|movements.py| implements convenience movements-related function,
    such as walking and kick.

  \item \verb|nao_defaults.json| stores all project-global settings, such as
    the IP-address of the robot, or color calibration results.

\end{itemize}
