\section{Text to speech}

During the implementation of our solution for the objective stated in \ref{sec
  problem statement} we included suitable functions to get a feedback about
what the robot is doing at the moment during code execution. In addition to the
text output on the console we decided to let the robot speak about what he is
doing using Voice output. We therefore implemented a Speech output using the
official Aldebaran NAOqi API \cite{naoqi-sdk} which provides a Text-to-Speech
function, which, unfortunately is blocking. So we extended the Speech output in
such a way, that the Speech output does not influence the actual execution of
the program by running it in a separate thread. We also ensured, that the robot
does not repeat the same sentence over and over again, if he remains in the
same state.

\section{Goal confirmation}

It makes sense to let the robot check, if he has actually scored a goal after
he performed a goal kick. We therefore implemented a simple goal confirmation
algorithm, which is visualized in figure \ref{j figure goal confirmation}. The
robot tries to find the goal and the ball. If the ball is between both
goalposts after the goal kick is performed, a successful goal kick is
confirmed.
