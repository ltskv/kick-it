\section{Ball Alignment}

Now that the robot aligned itself with the ball and the goal, it has to move to the
right position, from which it can perform the kick. Depending on the situation, it
was feasible to program the robot to automatically select which foot to kick the ball with;
however, due to time constraints we decided to program the robot to kick only with the left foot.
In order to program the robot to correctly position its left foot in front of the ball,
we identified the right position that the ball should be positioned at,
within the robotâ€™s lower camera as shown in \ref{p figure ball-alignment}.
We then experimentally determined the extents of this region.
The algorithm therefore is for the robot to gradually adjust its position in small steps,
until the ball image reaches the target, which would trigger the robot to perform the kick. \\
Our tests have shown that this method was quite robust and gave consistent results.
We registered no case where the robot missed the ball or hit it with the edge of the foot.\\

\section{Kick}

The final milestone in the goal scoring project is naturally the kick. Before
we started working on the kick, we set the requirements that our
implementation must meet. Firstly and most importantly, the robot shouldn't
fall down during and after performing the kick. Secondly, the kick performance should be efficient,
thus ideally only one attempt would be necessary for the ball to reach the goal.
Consequently, we opted for a powerful kick which can cover high distances. \\

As shown in \ref{p figure kick} To obtain our strong kick, First the robot will use its ankle joints to shift
its weight to the base leg to compensate for the gravity and to avoid any collision between the kicking foot and the floor.
After this, the robot will be able to lift the
kicking leg to achieve a stronger swing. Finally, the robot will perform the swing and return
to the standing position safely. Both raising the leg and doing the swing require
precise coordinated joint movements, so we had to conduct experiments to
establish the correct joint angles and the movement speed. \\

An important drawback of our implementation is that the swing makes the whole
process slower, but we weren't able to design a strong and stable kick without
using the swing. Nevertheless, the tests that we performed have shown that our
implementation satisfies our requirements, and hence the last milestone was
successfully completed.\\
