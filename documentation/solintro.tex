\chapter{Our solution}

To achieve our objective, we identified ten big milestones that needed to be
completed. These milestones can roughly be grouped into perception, approach
planing, approach and the kick. In this chapter we will give our solutions to
the problems posed by each of the milestones, and at the end the resulting goal
scoring strategy will be presented. We will now start with the lower level
perception milestones and will gradually introduce higher level behaviors.
