\chapter{Our solution}

To achieve our objective, we identified ten big milestones that needed to be
completed, which are:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Ball detection

  \item Goal detection

  \item Field detection

  \item Turning to ball

  \item Distance measurement

  \item Approach planning

  \item Ball approach

  \item Goal alignment

  \item Ball alignment

  \item Kick.

\end{enumerate}

In this chapter we will give our solutions to the problems posed by each of the
milestones, and at the end the resulting goal scoring strategy will be
presented. We will now start with the lower level detection milestones and
will gradually introduce higher level behaviors.
